        <h2>Will Your Information Be Shared With Anyone?</h2>
        <p>We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.</p>
        <p>We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose.</li>

            <li><strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong> Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.</li>

        <h2>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements).</p>
        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

    <div class="droplet slide-up" style="animation-delay: 0.7s;">
        <h2>How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>
        <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.</p>
        <p>Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our platform is at your own risk. You should only access the platform within a secure environment.</p>
